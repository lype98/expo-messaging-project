# expo-messaging-project

This is an expo based messaging app for android that lets you log in/register with firebase and start a direct message with anyone registered or create a group with multiple people.
This project mainly uses expo, react native, firebase and redux. This was done while I did not have much knowledge of these technologies and was made in less than a week as proof that I could learn the basics and could apply them to make this app.

## Requirements

1. Please make sure "expo" and "yarn" are installed globally
2. [Please download this file to the project's root folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kCnK58XyJxRfx2DTgL7EqgDX2ZQN3FvO/view?usp=sharing) or copy the contents of the file in that link and create an "app.config.js" file in the project's root folder to paste the copied contents into it. (this is so the app can have access to the firebase)

Optionally, but recommended, please install "Expo Go" on android. Although this app can be run on web after initialising it was made with android in mind

## Initialising

1. in the root folder run:

    1.1. "yarn install"

    1.2. "expo start"

2. on "Expo Go" scan the QR code in the console or enter the URL (should be something like exp://192.168.1.241:19000)

    2.1. alternatively press "w" in the console to open the app on the web (not recommended as the styling was not made for web)
